# SIMPLE TO-DO APPLICATION ON MERN WEB STACK

MERN Web stack consists of following components:
MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.
ExpressJS: A server side Web Application framework for Node.js.
ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

Application Code Setup
Create a new directory for your To-Do project:

![`Create a new directory for your To-Do project:`](./Images/Create-a-new-directory-for-your-To-Do-project.png)

Next, you will use the command npm init to initialise your project, so that a new file named package.json will be created.

# INSTALL EXPRESSJS

Express helps to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs.

# MODELS

Install mongoose

Now comes the interesting part, since the app is going to make use of Mongodb which is a NoSQL database, we need to create a model.

A model is at the heart of JavaScript based applications, and it is what makes it interactive.

# STEP 2 â€“ FRONTEND CREATION

it is time to create a user interface for a Web client (browser) to interact with the application via API. To start out with the frontend of the To-do app, we will use the create-react-app command to scaffold our app.
